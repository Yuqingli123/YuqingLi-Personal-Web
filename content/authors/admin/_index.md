I am currently a master student at University of Chicago studying Sociology. My research interests include work and occupation, gender inequality in the workplace, and sociology of sports. Prior to studying at UChicago, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am looking forward to an opportunity to conduct a labor study research in a research master program (Please see the research proposal in "Projects").
